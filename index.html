      <h1>Journaling this Page</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my Web Development Project! Everything you see on this page is built by hand using manual HTML, CSS, and (eventually) JavaScript coding. This is my personal COVID-19 project, to learn how to write code. As I write this, I've been at it for about a month now - the goal was to first learn HTML and CSS, then JavaScript. Step 1 - learn those three languages, develop a website by hand.  Once I feel comfortable with that, my goal is to move onto something else - I was initially interested in learning Python, but I reserve the right to change my mind when I get to that point, so we shall see.</p>

      <p>I will use this section of the site a my "journal." I'm sure it will be boring to anyone who has no interest in development work, but it will certainly serve a purpose for me. Each time I run into a problem, do more research, and eventually solve the problem, I'll write about it here. That will help me to retain the things I'm learning about. So, I now have about a month of learning to journal about, so here goes...</p>

      <p>I've been interested in learning how to do coding for a long time. For one, I've dabbled with writing scripts during my IT career (mostly Batch scripts), and I always found it to be extremely therapeutic. As a Christian, I have this theory that since we are "created" in the image of God - who is Himself the Creator of all things - it brings us tremendous joy to create things ourselves. "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good" (Genesis 1:31). For two, you can make some really good money if you're good at it! &#128512; (&#128072;I just Googled <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_emojis.asp'>how to do emoji's using HTML</a> LOL). So, I heard about a program called <a href='vetswhocode.io'><i>Vets Who Code</i></a>, which is a non-profit organization which pairs veterans aspiring to be coders with mentors, and I decided I wanted to sign up for the program. In order to be accepted into the program, there is a bunch of prerequisites which have to be met, and eventually there is a Capstone Project to conclude the Prerequisite work - Develop a Website using only manual code. Needless to say, this is my Capstone Project to hopefully get accepted into the program.</p>

      <p>The easiest part of the prerequisite work was learning markdown and creating a "professional presence" out on different websites (i.e. <a href='https://github.com/barry-dudley1'>GitHub</a>, <a href='https://twitter.com/BarryDDudleyJr1'>Twitter</a>, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/barry-dudley-02961712b/'>LinkedIn</a>, etc.). I'm hoping to put a footer on this page tonight with some social media icons linking to those profiles. If you are here, and those are not yet in the footer, it means I haven't gotten that far yet. I made each on in the parenthical clickable in case you want to check me out.</p>

      <p>Up to this point, I've created all my accounts on all the required social media sites. I have also completed the 14 Chapter course for HTML and CSS at <a href='https://www.internetingishard.com/'>Interneting is Hard</a>. That technically only leaves me one more prerequisite requirement to complete (begin learning JavaScript) before I can apply to the Vets Who Code program. I just prefer to get some practice with HTML and CSS before moving on to JavaScript, so that's what lead me to start building this site first. Once this site it built, I hope to be more comfortable with the basics, and then I'll find some feature to add to the page using JavaScript.</p>

      <p>The first challenge I ran into was with my menu bar. I know, I made it real far! lol (and it doesn't even have a clickable menu yet). Using flexbox to get my logo and name aligned in the top left the way I wanted it was trickier that I imagined. For about an hour on my first night building this page, I struggled to get the page to look any different regardless of what I did. I was growing a bit frustrated each time I went to my browser, hit F5, and still didn't see the content change location in the top of my screen. I finally realized that my stylesheet was named "styles.css" but the &#60;head&#62; section of my index.html file was pointed to "style.css" - yeah, I forgot the 's'. I guess that was a sort of "right of passage" for an aspiring coder. Once I changed my filename in the index.html &#60;head&#62; I was able to finally put my contents neatly into the top left of my page with some refresher flexbox guidance <a href='https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/'>Here</a>.</p>

      <p>The next challenge I ran into was changing the font that my name was typed in next to the logo. My inspiration for the design of this page is the <i>Interneting is Hard</i> site where I learned how to do HTML and CSS. I really like the asthetics of the site, and I also figured that it would be more challenging trying to copy someone else design than to come up with any random design of my own. Afterall, I may never design my own site as an actual Web Developer as I will probably need to built what the customer or designer tells me to build (I'm just the backend nerd). The mistake I was making with the font, is I was not downloading a web font (WOFF Format). Once I found a font I liked (Candela Webfont from <a href='https://www.fontsquirrel.com/'>FontSquirrel</a>), I went back to the <a href='https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/web-typography/'>Web Topography Lesson</a> in the Interneting is Hard course to refresh my memory on the CSS syntax for using a Locally Hosted Font.</p>

      <p>So, that's where I'm at up to this point. I certainly haven't covered ever single problem or hiccup I've run into during this project. The biggest challenge for me up until now is with flexbox, and just using the right syntax for CSS in general. Luckily, there are countless free resources online to learn this stuff. One thing I left out is the tool I've decided to use. The course I took recommends Atom Text Editor, so I used that editor through the entire course. As I was re-reviewing the Prereqs for the Vets Who Code program, I remembered that they recommend using VS Code (as does just about every other coder online), so I switched about a week ago. Although I was taking on a new project to learn how to use a different text editor because I was already so comfortable using Atom at that point, it was time well spent. I used an entire night learning how to set up my VS Code console to my liking, and I now really love it, and it is saving me a bunch of time and effort. Without going into too much detail, the Extensions that I've installed, and am really stoked about are: Bracket Pair Colorizer, Browser Preview, CSS Peek, and GitLens.</p>

      <p>So, there you have it! I'm gonna push these updates to my GitHub's main branch, and onto the world wide web for everyone to see! I will have to update my CSS to add some style to this journal later since it took me so long to write this.  Thanks for checking out my site!</p>
